# AirBnB (a.k.a. Winter Break 2020/2021 project) 

This project is part of my journey at [Strive School](https://strive.school).\
Our teacher assistant [Ubeyt](https://github.com/ubeytdemirr) gave us this challenge to review all past topics. \
As for most coding project, this will be (hopefully) be updated and fixed. \
Started: **Dec 2020** \
Challenge due: **5 Jan 2021**

##Features still missing: 
-Add photos to houses (only possible through postman) **ISSUE: file is undefined in response, possibly an API problem** \
-Add photos to reviews (same as above, only there is no endpoint for it becacuse I wasn't successful in making the first one work) \ 
-Login function 
-Search function 
-Book with dates (you can book and unbook) 
-Email (API seems to go through but you never get the email, code looks fine, but my sendgrid account seems to be suspended. Still have to try with a brand new one.)
-PDF/CVS export functions 

##Notes: 
-This was my first project using flex-grid! I was really used to just position: absolute everything and then make several media queries, \ 
but I am now free of all nighters trying to make a website reponsive :D \
-Wherever you see "NaN" in the screenshots I still need to put a conditional render on the ratings. \
-The AddHouse component is madeup basing on AirBnB color scheme.\
